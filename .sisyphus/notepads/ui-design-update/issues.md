## 2026-01-25 - CSS Variables Not Being Added

**Problem**: Delegated task to visual-engineering agent to add CSS variables to styles.css, but after 2 attempts the file remains unchanged (still 85 lines, no CSS variables added).

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Initial delegation with full context
2. Resume with explicit instructions and exact code to add

**Current Status**: Agent claims completion but verification shows no changes made.

**Decision**: Will need to implement CSS variable updates directly or try a different approach.

**Root Cause**: Unclear - agent may not have write permissions or may be misunderstanding the task.
